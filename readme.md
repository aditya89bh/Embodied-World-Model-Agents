# 🌍 Embodied & World-Model Agents  
_From Perception to Imagination_

This repository is a **systematic exploration of world-models and embodiment for AI agents**.

The goal is not robotics demos or game-playing agents.

The goal is to understand and implement **how an agent models reality**, predicts consequences, imagines futures, and grounds its decisions in a causal world.

This repo builds on prior work in:
- Memory Agents (continuity, learning, identity)
- Reasoning & Planning Agents (goals, strategies, failure awareness)

Here, intelligence is no longer abstract.

It is **situated**.
