# Project E5 – Experience Memory & Prediction Error
_Learning From When Reality Disagrees_

This project introduces **experience memory**: the ability of an agent to
compare imagined outcomes with real outcomes, detect mismatch, and update
its internal world model.

E4 allowed the agent to imagine futures.
E5 allows the agent to **learn when those imaginations were wrong**.

This is where adaptation begins.

## Why This Project Exists

Planning alone is not intelligence.

An intelligent agent must:
- notice when reality deviates from expectation
- remember those deviations
- adjust future predictions and behavior

Without this, agents hallucinate competence.
